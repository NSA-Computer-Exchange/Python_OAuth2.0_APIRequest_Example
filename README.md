# Python OAuth2.0 APIRequest Example

To get full documentation head over here: [Documentation](https://nsa-computer-exchange.github.io/Python_OAuth2.0_APIRequest_Example/)

This file is a working example of how you can request an access token from your tenants access token url and use that token to make an API request.

Be sure to update the sections in the script file like this: '<< SAAK value from .ionapi >>' to use your credentials from the .ionapi file you downloaded when you created a backend service.  

To run it:
1. Update the sections mentioned above
2. In your python interpreter type: `python python_authtoken_apirequest.py`
3. If you get module not found errors, ensure you have the requests and urllib3 libraries installed and/or your environment is setup correctly.
4. You can install the required libraries bu running `pip install << required library >>`

If you have any trouble running the script, feel free to contact us at: support@nsacom.com
